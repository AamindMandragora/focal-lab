"""Track decoding steps where the grammar constraint was NOT applied.

Why this exists
----------------
`SyncodeLogitsProcessor` is supposed to force every generated token to match
a grammar. But it has two paths where it gives up and lets the model pick any
token at all: a parse error, or a partial code with no acceptable next token.
When that happens, the step was decoded unconstrained -- the grammar had no
effect on it. That does not necessarily make the output wrong (the model can
still write something valid on its own), which is exactly why it is dangerous:
a run can silently drop the constraint on some steps and still show a good
validity score, and that score gets read as evidence that constrained
decoding works.

This module is the count that used to not exist. Before this, the decoder had
only `self.parse_failed`, a bool that could not tell one skipped step apart
from ten thousand, and a second failure path that did not even set that bool.

Kept pure and dependency-free (no torch/transformers) so it can be imported
and unit-tested in an environment where the heavy decoding stack is not
installed.
