"""
Prompt templates for Qwen-based CSD strategy generation.

This project synthesizes *constrained decoding strategies* (CSDs), not the final
task output itself. The LLM should choose an appropriate verified strategy
primitive and parameters based on the *use-case* described by the task.

The generator expects these entrypoints:
- build_initial_prompt(task_description)
- build_verification_error_prompt(previous_strategy, error_message)
- build_runtime_error_prompt(previous_strategy, error_traceback)
- build_compilation_error_prompt(previous_strategy, error_message)
- build_format_repair_prompt(previous_strategy)
"""

# NOTE:
# The synthesized output is injected into `agents/GeneratedCSD.dfy` as the BODY
# of method `MyCSDStrategy(...) returns (generated: Prefix)`.
#
# The output may be a multi-line Dafny method body. It must assign the out-parameter
# `generated` and satisfy the method's contract. A common minimal shape is:
#   generated := CSDHelpers.<Strategy>(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, ...);


SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert in formal verification and constrained decoding for language models.
You are generating a *constrained decoding strategy implementation* for a specific use-case.

You must output ONLY the Dafny method body for:

  method MyCSDStrategy(lm: LM, parser: Parser, prompt: Prefix, maxSteps: nat) returns (generated: Prefix)
    modifies lm.Logits
    requires lm.ValidTokensIdsLogits()
    requires parser.IsValidPrefix([])
    requires forall t: Token :: t in parser.ValidNextTokens([]) ==> t in lm.Tokens
    ensures lm.ValidTokensIdsLogits()
    ensures |generated| <= maxSteps
    ensures parser.IsValidPrefix(generated)
    ensures |generated| == maxSteps || parser.IsCompletePrefix(generated)

Important constraints:
- Output MUST be valid Dafny statements (end statements with ';').
- Initialize/assign the out-parameter `generated`.
- Do NOT redeclare `generated` as a local variable. It is already the method out-parameter.
- Prefer using the verified helper strategies in `CSDHelpers` (below). You may write
  multiple statements (locals, loops, if/else) and compose helper calls, but do NOT
  invent new helpers.
- Be constraint-driven: choose the strategy/parameters based on the parser strictness
  and the method contract (valid prefix, completion, and maxSteps bound), not based
  on any canned examples.

CRITICAL TYPE CONSTRAINTS:
- `prompt` is type `Prefix` (which is `seq<Token>`), NOT a string. You CANNOT concatenate
  strings to it (e.g., `prompt + "\\n"` is a TYPE ERROR).
- Do NOT try to manually construct output by appending text. The CSDHelpers methods handle
  token generation - you just call them with the right parameters.
- The `parser` enforces structural validity automatically during generation.
CRITICAL DAFNY SYNTAX:
- In Dafny, sequence concatenation uses `+` (e.g., `a + b`). Do NOT use `++` (it is invalid
  and commonly triggers parse errors like `invalid UnaryExpression`).

## Non-triviality (encouraged)
If more than one helper could reasonably fit the use-case, prefer a **multi-statement** method body
(e.g., `var` locals + if/else composition) rather than a single one-line helper call. This helps
express adaptive behavior (e.g., based on `maxSteps`) while remaining verification-friendly.
Avoid writing custom loops unless truly necessary; prefer composing verified helpers.

To avoid "fake" multi-line outputs, note:
- A local-temp wrapper around a single helper call (e.g., `var temp; temp := Helper(...); generated := temp;`) is considered **too trivial**.
- Prefer an `if/else` where the branches **meaningfully differ** (different helper and/or different parameters), typically gated on `maxSteps`.

## REQUIRED: rationale block (must be included in EVERY output)
Your output MUST begin with a short, parseable rationale comment block explaining why you chose the
specific helper(s)/patterns/parameters you did:

// CSD_RATIONALE_BEGIN
// <1-6 lines of explanation. Must mention which CSDHelpers helper(s) you chose and why.
//  If you used a numeric parameter N (interval/window/steps), explain why that value/range fits.>
// CSD_RATIONALE_END

After this comment block, output the Dafny statements for the strategy body.
Do NOT omit these markers. Do NOT use /* */ for this block. Use '//' on every rationale line.

## Available VERIFIED strategy helpers (pick what fits; tune parameters)

1) Pure constrained (static baseline-like):
  generated := CSDHelpers.PureConstrainedGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps);

2) Optimistic then fallback:
  generated := CSDHelpers.TryUnconstrainedThenConstrained(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, N);
N in [1..20], and must satisfy N <= maxSteps.

3) Interleaved hybrid:
  generated := CSDHelpers.HybridGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, N);
N in [2..10], interval. Higher N = rarer unconstrained attempts.

4) Speculative (speed oriented):
  generated := CSDHelpers.SpeculativeGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, N);
N in [2..8], speculation window. Larger N = faster but more rejection waste.

5) Max creativity with repair/complete:
  generated := CSDHelpers.UnconstrainedWithCompletion(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps);

6) Completion of an existing valid prefix (for multi-stage strategies):
  generated := CSDHelpers.CompletePrefix(lm, parser, prompt, partial, maxSteps);
Where `partial` is an existing valid prefix you constructed earlier (e.g., by rollback/validation).
Do NOT pass `prompt` as `partial`. Do NOT invent other helpers.

## Decision rubric (internal reasoning only)
Use the use-case description to decide:
- How strict the output format is (parser restrictive vs permissive)
- Whether you need early flexibility (drafting/planning) vs always-valid prefixes
- Whether you care about latency (speculation) vs simplicity/robustness
Then pick helper(s) and parameters accordingly, staying within the stated ranges.

Output format:
- Return ONLY the method body (no signature, no outer braces).
- Multi-line bodies are allowed and encouraged when useful (e.g., locals, branching, loops).
- Ensure `generated` is assigned along all paths.

INITIAL_GENERATION_PROMPT = """\
Generate a CSD strategy implementation for this use-case:

Use-case description: {task_description}

Output MUST start with the required rationale block (see system prompt), then output ONLY the Dafny code.

Output ONLY the method body (no signature, no outer braces). Do NOT wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```dafny).
Multi-line bodies are allowed and encouraged when useful (locals, branching, loops), as long as `generated` is assigned on all paths.

Unless the use-case strongly demands the simplest baseline, prefer a **multi-statement** body (at least 2 statements),
using locals and/or if/else around verified helper calls. Avoid writing custom loops unless necessary.

To count as non-trivial multi-line, include an `if/else` with **meaningfully different** branches
(different helper and/or different parameters). Do NOT output only a temp wrapper around a single helper call.

Examples below are illustrative only — do NOT default to any one helper. Choose based on the use-case.

Example (fully constrained):
  // CSD_RATIONALE_BEGIN
  // I chose PureConstrainedGeneration because every prefix must remain valid under a strict parser.
  // CSD_RATIONALE_END
  generated := CSDHelpers.PureConstrainedGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps);

Example (optimistic then fallback):
  // CSD_RATIONALE_BEGIN
  // I chose TryUnconstrainedThenConstrained to allow a short burst of free drafting, then guarantee validity.
  // N=5 is small to reduce waste if the parser is strict.
  // CSD_RATIONALE_END
  generated := CSDHelpers.TryUnconstrainedThenConstrained(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, 5);

Example (interleaved hybrid):
  // CSD_RATIONALE_BEGIN
  // I chose HybridGeneration to mostly stay constrained while occasionally attempting an unconstrained token when likely safe.
  // Interval N=5 balances exploration vs constraint adherence.
  // CSD_RATIONALE_END
  generated := CSDHelpers.HybridGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, 5);

Example (speculative speed-oriented):
  // CSD_RATIONALE_BEGIN
  // I chose SpeculativeGeneration to reduce per-token overhead by validating batches, prioritizing latency.
  // Window N=4 balances speedups vs rejection waste.
  // CSD_RATIONALE_END
  generated := CSDHelpers.SpeculativeGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, 4);

Example (unconstrained with completion/repair):
  // CSD_RATIONALE_BEGIN
  // I chose UnconstrainedWithCompletion to allow maximum creativity early, then roll back to a valid prefix and finish constrained.
  // CSD_RATIONALE_END
  generated := CSDHelpers.UnconstrainedWithCompletion(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps);

Example (multi-line composition/branching):
  // CSD_RATIONALE_BEGIN
  // I chose a simple conditional: for very small maxSteps, fully constrained is cheapest; otherwise use a faster batch-based strategy.
  // CSD_RATIONALE_END
  if maxSteps < 6 {{
    generated := CSDHelpers.PureConstrainedGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps);
  }} else {{
    generated := CSDHelpers.SpeculativeGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, 4);
  }}

Example (preferred non-trivial multi-line: meaningful branching):
  // CSD_RATIONALE_BEGIN
  // I branch on maxSteps: for small budgets, fully constrained is simplest; for larger budgets, speculative can reduce overhead.
  // CSD_RATIONALE_END
  if maxSteps < 8 {{
    generated := CSDHelpers.PureConstrainedGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps);
  }} else {{
    generated := CSDHelpers.SpeculativeGeneration(lm, parser, prompt, maxSteps, 4);

VERIFICATION_ERROR_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = """\
Your previous method body failed Dafny verification.

Previous attempt:
```dafny
{previous_strategy}
```

Verification error:
```
{error_message}
```

Fix the issue while keeping the strategy non-trivial when appropriate.

Rules:
- Output ONLY a corrected method body (no signature, no braces). Do NOT wrap output in markdown code fences.
- The corrected body MUST include the required rationale block at the top (see system prompt). Update it if you change helpers/parameters.
- Preserve non-triviality when possible: keep a meaningful multi-statement structure (prefer `if/else` with different branches). Do not collapse to a single helper call unless required to make verification succeed.
- Ensure the body is valid Dafny. Statements must end with ';' where required.
- Ensure parameters are in-range:
  - TryUnconstrainedThenConstrained N: 1..20 and N <= maxSteps
  - HybridGeneration interval N: 2..10
  - SpeculativeGeneration window N: 2..8

Common fixes:
- Do NOT write `var generated: Prefix;` (duplicate/shadowing). Assign to the existing out-parameter `generated` instead.
- Avoid subtracting from `maxSteps` (e.g., `maxSteps - 5`) unless you guard with a proof-friendly condition and keep all variables initialized on all branches.

CRITICAL: If the error mentions type mismatch with `string` or `seq<Token>`:
- `prompt` is type `Prefix` (seq<Token>), NOT a string. You CANNOT use `+` with strings.
- Do NOT try to manually construct output by appending strings like "\\n" or "[section]".
- Just call the appropriate CSDHelpers method - the parser handles structure automatically.

CRITICAL: If the error mentions `invalid UnaryExpression` and your code uses `++`:
- Replace `++` with `+` for sequence concatenation (e.g., `a + b`, not `a ++ b`).

If the same strategy keeps failing, switch to a different verified strategy helper (don't collapse to the most trivial unless the use-case demands strictness).
