"""Split-provenance guard and metadata for train/eval comparisons.

Why this module exists (incident 2026-07-17): synthesis runs default to the
TRAIN side of a split file, while baseline runs (run_legacy_fixed_strategy)
and re-evals default to the EVAL/TEST side. Three recorded cells (GSM
Qwen3.5-4B/9B, Spider Qwen3.5-4B) were launched with an acceptance bar
(--min-accuracy) that had been measured on the eval side, then scored on the
train side — an apples-to-oranges comparison that made metaDecode look far
under bars it was actually near. Nothing recorded which split a run used, so
the mismatch was only recoverable from wrapper logs.

This module fixes both halves at the root:

1. `check_bar_split_provenance(...)` — called at launch by run_synthesis.
   When a run uses a split file and a nonzero accuracy bar, the caller must
   declare which split the bar was measured on (--bar-split-name), and it
   must match the split being evaluated. A mismatch always refuses to start —
   there is no override flag; cross-split comparison is exactly the bug this
   guard exists to prevent.

2. `split_provenance_metadata(...)` — the split file/name (and declared bar
   split) that every synthesis report and eval output JSON now embeds, so any
   future number is traceable to its split without log forensics.

Pure logic, no heavy imports — unit-testable off-GPU.
