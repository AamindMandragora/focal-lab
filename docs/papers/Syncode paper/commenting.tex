%% NA: needs attention (rough writing whose correctness needs to be
%% verified) TBD: instructions for how to fix a gap ("Describe the
%% propagation by ...")  PROBLEM: bug or missing crucial bit

%% use \fXXX versions of these macros to put additional explanation
%% into a footnote.  The idea is that we don't want to interrupt the
%% flow of the paper or make it impossible to read because there are a
%% bunch of comments.

%% NA's (and TBDs, those less crucially) should be written so that
%% they flow with the text.
